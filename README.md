# How did giving birth during the Covid-19 pandemic impact mental health?
# Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualisation project
## Overview
In this exploratory data study, I wanted to find out whether giving birth during the Covid-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on postnatal mental health, and what conditions made someone particularly vulnerable to developing postnatal depression during this time. The dataset included maternal mental health scores delivery date, measures for the health of the baby at birth and the delivery experience, and personal circumstances of the *mother*, such as household income and education level. The data was collected from people living in Canada, an affluent country with an accessible, functioning healthcare system. 

Postnatal depression is a serious condition, which greatly impacts the health of the mother/parent, child and family. It is also a very common condition. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, about 1 in 10 cis-women/AFAB people developed it after giving birth. It is reasonable to predict that people who were pregnant and gave birth during the pandemic were particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems, in this time of public health crisis, social isolation, economic instability and general uncertainty about the future.  

The purpose of this project was to discover whether an external stressor, such as a global pandemic, worsens the mental health of people who give birth during this time, and whether individual circumstances make some people more vulnerable to this than others. My hope is that better understanding of the causes and contributors of postnatal depression can inform as to who is at risk and what support is needed, should another pandemic or largescale disaster occur in the future.

## Project Features
### Data source
* The data I used for this exploration is a subset from a larger study that is still ongoing, published here: https://osf.io/ha5dp/
* The protocol for the data collection was published here: https://www.researchprotocols.org/2021/4/e25407/

### Analysis Techniques and Statistical Methods
I conducted the analysis using Python, with the following libraries:
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks

I used various statistical tests to assess relationships and significance within the data:
- Mann Whitney-U
- One way ANOVA
- Pearson Correlation analysis

### Data Visualization
I visualised the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a variety of plots, including:
- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Box plots
- Line plots

For a detailed overview of the specific techniques and methods employed, please refer to the code in the project repository.
